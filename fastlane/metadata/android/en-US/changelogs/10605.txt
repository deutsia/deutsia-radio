## [1.6.5]

### Added
- **Custom genre tagging**: You can now type custom genres in the Add/Edit Radio Station dialog instead of being limited to the preset list
- **Clearnet over Tor fallback for Radio Registry API in force Tor mode**: Since Tor uptime is not 100%, added a clearnet-over-tor fallback. This means it will call the .onion, if that fails, it will use the clearnet API, but everything is accessed over Tor. Previously there was no fallback — if the .onion failed to load, no stations loaded

### Fixed
- **Cover art scaling**: Fixed placeholder cover art icon appearing small in mini player and now playing screen
- **Genre display**: Fixed radio registry browse showing network prefix in genre labels

### UI/UX Improvements
- Migrated dialogs, popups, layouts, and widgets from default Android/AppCompat to Material 3 design
- Genre filter dialogs now use radio button selection
