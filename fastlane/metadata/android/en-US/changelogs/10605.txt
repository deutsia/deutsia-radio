v1.6.5
Added custom genre tagging — you can now type custom genres in the Add/Edit Radio Station dialog instead of being limited to presets. Added clearnet-over-Tor fallback for Radio Registry API in force Tor mode: if the .onion fails, it falls back to the clearnet API routed over Tor, so stations always load. Fixed placeholder cover art appearing small in mini player and now playing screen. Fixed genre labels showing network prefix in radio registry browse. Migrated dialogs, popups, layouts, and widgets to Material 3 design. Genre filter dialogs now use radio button selection.
